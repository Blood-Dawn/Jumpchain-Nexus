# Why This Matters

Keeping a Jumpchain thriving over months (or years) means tracking more than raw points. The Jump Memory Hub stitches together:

1. **Story context** — Mentions link directly to perk, item, and companion records so you can resurface lore instantly.
2. **Operational clarity** — Pinned next actions prevent prep paralysis and highlight what needs attention before the next jump.
3. **Evidence trails** — Recaps and indexed PDFs provide receipts for how decisions were made, keeping continuity airtight.
4. **Search velocity** — Offline FTS5 search means you can find anything—even inside digitized jump docs—without leaving the app.

Use the help topics to deepen your mastery of each subsystem, then let automation carry the bookkeeping while you explore new worlds.
