# Drawbacks

Drawbacks and scenarios provide bonus currency or narrative hooks at the cost of extra complications. They are central to balancing gauntlet difficulty and storytelling stakes.

## Why this matters

- **Budget Offsets** – Drawback values alter your net spend. Recording them accurately keeps stipend math from drifting over long chains.
- **Risk Registry** – Logging drawback text lets you review cumulative hazards and build contingency plans between jumps.
- **Export Context** – Exports pull drawback blurbs into recaps and dossiers; consistent entries keep the narrative tight.

### Tracking Tips

1. Note whether the drawback is mandatory, optional, or scenario-exclusive.
2. Capture reward wording verbatim—many include conditional payouts that affect later planning.
3. Flag suspension states (taken, waived, mitigated) so you can differentiate legacy drawbacks from active ones when filtering timelines.
