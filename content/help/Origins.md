# Origins

Choosing an origin defines your Jumper's starting assumptions inside a new universe. Origins bundle narrative context with mechanical hooks such as discounts, free perks, or access to unique equipment.

## Why this matters

- **Budget Planning** – Origins often determine which perk categories receive automatic discounts. Locking that in early keeps your point routing efficient.
- **Continuity** – Consistent origin decisions maintain your character's internal story logic and help exports read coherently.
- **Automation** – Many builder rules (freebies, form toggles, import limits) key off the origin index. Capturing origins accurately lets Jumpchain-Nexus keep auto-calculations trustworthy.

### Best Practices

1. Capture the origin *name* and any sub-track (Student, Veteran, etc.).
2. Record the free perks granted at entry so the system can reconcile zero-cost entries.
3. Tag any conditional modifiers (temporary, gauntlet bonuses, restricted worlds) inside the note field for fast search later.
