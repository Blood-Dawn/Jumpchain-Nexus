# Gauntlets

Gauntlets remix a jump into a high-pressure challenge with locked loadouts, aggressive timers, and forced drawback stacks. They are the ultimate stress test of chain resilience.

## Why this matters

- **Resource Locks** – Gauntlets often freeze import banks or stipends. Tracking them preserves accurate stipend math and alerts you before exports strip perks unintentionally.
- **Risk Assessment** – Each gauntlet adds compounded failure points. Documenting modifiers helps the Next Actions queue surface the most urgent prep tasks.
- **Lore Continuity** – Because gauntlets disrupt normal pacing, weaving them into recaps ensures your narrative stays coherent instead of jarring.

### Quick Capture

1. Flag the jump as a gauntlet in the Jump card.
2. Record enforced drawbacks and banned perks so planners respect the restrictions.
3. Note the survival/win condition and downtime granted afterward—this informs future scheduling.
