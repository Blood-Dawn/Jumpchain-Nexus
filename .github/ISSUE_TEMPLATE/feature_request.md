**Summary**
What improvement or new capability would you like to see in Jumpchain Nexus?

**Motivation / problem statement**
Describe the workflow pain point or narrative gap this would address. If this is about the legacy WPF app, note that it is maintained for reference only and major changes will target the modern desktop client.

**Proposed solution**
Outline the behaviour, UI, or data changes you are envisioning. Mock-ups and example exports are welcome.

**Alternatives you've considered**
List any workarounds or alternate approaches you tried.

**Affected build / version**
Which app release or commit are you using today?

**Additional context**
Anything else we should know to scope the request? The Jumpchain Nexus maintainers review this queue and prioritise based on overall impact.
